## About

The International is my bot for [Screeps](https://screeps.com/), thematically based after [communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) aesthetics. Owned rooms are called communes, offensive and defensive forces are called the Red Army, economic workers are known as the Proletariat, and the Revolutionaries establish new communes and rebuild destroyed ones.

This bot intended to provide experienced and new players a reference for when they get stuck, need inspiration, or want to laugh at some terrible code. Comments are used commonly, and code is structured so it can be easily understood, replicated, and expanded upon. Please follow similar guidelines if you make a pull request ðŸ™‚.

Feel welcome to fork it and otherwise use it, however do not be overly aggressive on the Screeps world, especially to newer players. The bot is intended to be automated, but can perform manual actions via the console. It has an information panel showing progress, events, economy and military, and more.

If you have specific questions or want to discuss the bot, please join our discord server.

## Requirements

Please read the about section before installing and using this bot.

First you'll want to download or fork the repository.

### NPM

Next, if you don't have it already, install Node Package Manager so we can install other things:

```powershell
npm install
```

Then, when in the project folder, you'll want to install the devDependencies like so:

```powershell
npm install --only=dev
```

And that's it. Join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/5QubDsB786) if you need help.

## Usage

Using [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) we will translate the code into a single js file, which will be used in environments set in the screeps.json file. This reduces cpu usage, and compiles the code so it can be run by Screeps while we develop using folders and typescript.

First, rename example.screeps.json to screeps.json and fill in the required information for each environment you want to run the bot in.

To then run the bot, use the command `npm run push-mmo` replacing mmo with the environment you want to compile to. This wiil initially compile to the environment, as well as automatically compiling and pushing to the environment on code changes.

For more information, please go to the [wiki](https://github.com/CarsonBurke/The-International-Screeps-Bot/wiki/Usage)

### Grafana

You can set up [grafana](https://grafana.com/), a graphing and stat recording tool, using the screepsplus supported tool [hosted agent](https://screepspl.us/services/grafana/). With this, metrics recorded in Memory.stats can be viewed. There is a JSON model in this repository, grafanaModel.json which you can copy and paste to use to instantiate your graphs. 

### Private server

If you'd like to use rollup to compile to a private server, you'll need to download and configure [screepsmod-auth](https://github.com/ScreepsMods/screepsmod-auth) to push your code.

I'd also suggest using this less-laggy tool [steamless-client](https://github.com/laverdet/screeps-steamless-client ) to watch your private server run from the comfort of your browser.

## Contribution
